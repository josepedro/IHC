% Bibliography entries each contain some subset of standard data entries:
% address: Publisher's address (usually just the city, but can be the full address for lesser-known publishers)
% annote: An annotation for annotated bibliography styles (not typical)
% author: The name(s) of the author(s) (in the case of more than one author, separated by and)

% institution: The institution that was involved in the publishing, but not necessarily the publisher
% journal: The journal or magazine the work was published in

% series: The series of books the book was published in (e.g. "The Hardy Boys" or "Lecture Notes in Computer Science")
